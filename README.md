# Module4b-Programming-Assignment1
This is in compliance with Module4b Week 1's requirement to make 4 Plots
Each plot should :
 - be saved to a png file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels
 - be named plot1.png, plot2.png, etc
 - have separate R codes plot1.R, plot2.R, etc and should include code for reading the data for reproduceability
 - be added to the top level folder (png and R)
 
The data was taken from  "UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository" (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) particularly the  “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)

The dataset is 20MB with description " Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available."

There are 9 variables in the dataset and are taken from the  "UCI web site" (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption) :
1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
